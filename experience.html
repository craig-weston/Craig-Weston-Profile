      <p class="tag location">Below are some of the points I keep in mind while designing websites:</p>
    </header>

    <main class="flex">

     <div class="card">
        <h2>Clean Code</h2>
        
        <p>All of my code is clean, semantic, organized, and fully conforms to the W3C standards. It is kept as simple and readable (using comments!) as possible to ensure it can be easily updated in the future. This entire website was built entirely using just HTML & CSS!</p>
      </div> 
      
      
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Responsive Designs</h2>
        <p>A responsive website is a must for any company looking to stay ahead and up to date with the technological world. This simply means that your site will workl on any screen including mobile phones, tablets, PC's and just about any other screen size. A functional website that works well and looks great across all of these screen sizes will mean your company can have a broader reach and appeal to more clients and visitors to your website.</p>
